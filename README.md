# Classes and Modules in Modern JavaScript

"Java is to JavaScript as Ham is to Hamster" -- Jeremy Keith

Anyone who has been in the web development business for a while has almost certainly had to patiently explain to a non-technical person that, despite the similarity of their names, Java and JavaScript are two very different languages. I used to be able to short-circuit the conversation, when talking to fellow programmers, by saying, "In Java, everything is a class. In JavaScript, everything is a function." Now, in modern versions of both languages, that distinction isn't as clever as it used to be. Java now has lambda expressions (free-standing functions like JavaScript), and JavaScript now has classes. 

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) discusses advances in the JavaScript language -- like classes and modules -- that bring it closer to the programming paradigms that Java developers are familiar with. JavaScript developers now have privacy, scoping, and encapsulation that should make Java developers feel more at home.
